# Airport-departure-board
This was made to run on a system with Apache and PHP. I used php 8 and linux but should run with other options. Ensure you have php-curl installed (see here how to install it: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6382539/call-to-undefined-function-curl-init)

Once you copy these files to your root folder, you can go to base.php and something should show up. 

You can set the number of rows that show up on the arrivals and departures lists at the top of the base.php file. This will allow you to set the results list to the size of your screen.

The selection of the airport on the settings file is not done yet. Feel free to fork this repository and do it for the community, me included.
